# How to install

- Import a new dashboard from the file gatling.json into Grafana

This version https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/21776-gatling/ works with one datasource only, it is an external dashboard.

This version works well with the __source__ variable. We can use the same dashboard for different datasources.
